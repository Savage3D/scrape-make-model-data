# scrape-make-model-data
This repo contains two scripts:
- app.js - for scraping data about car makes and appropriate models from "mobile.de";
- query.js - for preparing SQL query to insert scraped data into MS SQL Server database 
  (other SQL-based databases should not complain as well)

If you are looking just for SQL query, you can find it here: https://github.com/Savage3D/car-makes-models-data

## Technology stack:
- Node.js
- Puppeteer.js
